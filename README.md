# This mod is very W.I.P

To test this mod you need to:
- Have BepInEx installed on TABZ 5.1
- Download the pre-release
- Place the dll on the plugins folder of BepInEx
- Replace the file game `globalgamemanagers` with `globalgamemanagers-vr` (make a copy of the original just in case)
- Have a hmd connected
